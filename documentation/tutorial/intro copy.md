# Pufferfish

Pufferfish is an extensible html templating engine that generates raw html, meaning that it will not affect load times of websites.

A full-blown javascript framework is sometimes a bit overkill for a static website. Pufferfish adds some simple templating to html so you don't have to use such a framework for small projects or for pages that require fast loading. Pufferfish will compile your files to raw html.

## Download
You can get Pufferfish from ruby gems.
```bash
gem install pufferfish
```

You can also download it from GitHub packages:
```bash
gem install pufferfish --source "https://rubygems.pkg.github.com/jomy10"
```
